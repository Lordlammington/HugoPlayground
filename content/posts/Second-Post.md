Here we are, Second Post allready, Feeling good!

While I'm a bit away from making something like Shane's Website I'll look into making my own custom Shortcodes.
As mentioned in the previous post Custom shortcodes are bits of HTML you decide to insert into a larger Compiled Markdown document. Imagine them like smarties inside a cake. You can put them wherever you like and the larger page doesn't do anyhting other then render them where they're supposed to be.

{{< NumberGuess 88>}}

Cool Huh? 

Given that shortcodes are their own thing,  {{<Rainbow >}} You can do this using the .Inner method {{< /Rainbow >}}

And does it cause a problem After?
